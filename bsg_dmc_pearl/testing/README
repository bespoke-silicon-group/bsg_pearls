Directory contains files for testing the DMC pearl RTL block.
Testing involves:
    - Trace generation: 
        - Tag programming: bsg_tag_boot.tr
        The above .tr file contains configuration parameters to be programmed. The above .tr file is converted to a SystemVerilog ROM module.
        - Transfer programming: bsg_dmc_trace_gen.py
        The above script generates Read/Write commands to be issued to DMC, along with data to be written/read data to be checked in a .tr format file. The .tr trace file can be converted to a SystemVerilog ROM module.
        - Trace replay modules for tag and R/W operations
    - Trace conversion and transfers to and from DMC: Data/Command to be written to the DMC is converted to Xilinx UI interface and propagated to the the DRAM controller.
    - Clock monitoring: A clock monitor is used to continuously monitor the time period of a downsampled version of DDR clock. In case of a frequency mismatch due to PVT reasons, transfers are halted, time period is reset to correct value followed by resumed transfers.

RUNNING TESTS:
    - make bsg_tag_boot_rom.v
        To generate bsg_tag_boot_rom.v from bsg_tag_boot_rom.tr
    - make bsg_dmc_trace_rom.tr
        To generate bsg_dmc_trace_rom.tr from bsg_dmc_trace_rom.py
    - make bsg_dmc_trace_rom.v
        To generate bsg_dmc_trace_rom.v from bsg_dmc_trace_rom.tr
    - make elaborate synth_tb=1
        To compile TB in synthesisable mode.
    - make elaborate 
        To compile TB in non-synthesisable mode; default mode.
    - make run:
        To run the simulation - execute the simv.
    - make dve:
        Launch DVE with vcdplus.vpd loaded for waveform debug
